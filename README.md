# Taiwan Air Pollution Data Analysis Report

## 1. Overview
This report provides an analysis of Taiwan's air quality data, focusing on hourly and daily pollutant trends from 2016 to 2021. The study involves data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis of various air pollutants.

## 2. Data Processing
### 2.1 Importing Libraries and Data
Essential Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used for data manipulation and visualization. The dataset was loaded and prepared for analysis.

### 2.2 Data Cleaning
- Converted object-type data to float for numerical analysis.
- Identified and handled missing values using statistical imputation (e.g., mean or median).
- Filtered out unnecessary data points to ensure accuracy.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
### 3.1 Overview of Air Quality Monitoring Stations
- Geographical locations of monitoring stations were analyzed.
- The distribution of monitoring station statuses across Taiwan was visualized.

### 3.2 Temporal Analysis of Air Quality
- Daily averages of pollutants were computed to assess trends over time.
- Seasonal variations and yearly trends in AQI (Air Quality Index) were explored.
- Box plots were used to analyze pollutant distribution over the six-year period (2016â€“2021).

## 4. Visualization and Key Findings
### 4.1 Geospatial Analysis
- A map was generated to display air quality monitoring station locations.
- Visualization of pollutant concentration at different sites.

### 4.2 Trend Analysis
- Time series plots revealed fluctuations in pollutant levels over time.
- AQI variations were analyzed by year to identify trends and anomalies.

## 5. Conclusion
- Significant seasonal and yearly trends in air pollution were identified.
- Missing data handling strategies were discussed for improving accuracy.
- Further studies could incorporate external factors such as meteorological conditions to enhance insights.

## 6. Future Work
- Implement machine learning models to predict air quality trends.
- Explore correlations between pollution levels and meteorological factors.
- Enhance data visualization with interactive dashboards.
